§l// Thanks to you all //

From a buggy mess of a concept to a project that takes a whole team.
This is the biggest project I ever started, believe it or not.
There's been ups and downs and some panic here and there but we've made it.

I'd like to thank you all for the support this mod has gotten.
To everyone who played and worked on this project - Thank you.
From the deepest parts of my heart, thank you.

This isn't the end yet, there's more coming.
Revamps, more blocks, more lore.

- JustMili
