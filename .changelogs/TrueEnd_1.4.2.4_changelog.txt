**FABRIC PORT IS ON ITS WAY!**

## Removed
- Removed Herobrine

## Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements
- Changed repawn mechanic after death in NWaD
  - instant respawn like it was "just a bad dream"
- Hardcore players no longer get softlocked in NWaD
  - If you play in hardcore, now you can escape by attempting to kill yourself; the damage event gets cancelled, and you get teleported back to your spawn.
