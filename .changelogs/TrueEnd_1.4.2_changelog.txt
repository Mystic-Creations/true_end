# Important Notices
- Mod's **Player Inventory Manager**'s saveInventory method was changed (and optimized) to work with Curios API, use `/trueend convertInvBackup <dimension>` to convert your inventory backup from the old type to the new one
  - Old system probably didn't even save Curios API, but better be safe than sorry

**FABRIC PORT IS ON ITS WAY!** (Fuck it, we ball)
