# Description
True End follows the part of the End Poem that talk's about that Minecraft is player's dream and basing itself on the dream theory.
After defeating the dragon and jumping into the portal, the player will be met with not the overworld but the reality, the player woke up and is now *"Beyond The Dream"*, in a place that isn't like modern Minecraft but just like the good old Alpha (v1.1.2_01).
The same voices as in the end poem will address the player in chat, surprised about player's awakening. Leaving you with a mysterious cube and a goal to reach, the player has to play through it and gather resources and prepare for quite the adventure to travel thousands of blocks, to go back to what the voices called the player's dream.

Although, despite it all, you are not alone in your world, there is something lurking in the distance.

Wake up, *Player.*
